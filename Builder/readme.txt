Create an exercise that helps students understand the use of an object-oriented design pattern of your choice! The exercise is defined by these parts:
- A reference solution that can be expected from OOP learners (1-5 short classes).
- A starter code to be shared with students at the beginning (usually created from the above by deleting lines).
- 1-3 paragraphs of instruction text that describes students what to do.
A good exercise not just requires a certain way of coding but tries to make it visible why that design is preferable in professional coding practice.
